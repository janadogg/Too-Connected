                    <p>Hey! My name is Kristjana Dögg Jónsdóttir and I am highly addicted to social media. I  feel that makes me the 
                        perfect person to teach you about how balanced social media is something we need to master in our everyday lives. 
                        I know what you are thinking, is she crazy? Well I am trying to get teenagers to think about the amount of time 
                        they spend on social media so I think the answer to that question would be yes!<br> 
                        <br> 
                        But let’s start from the beginning. As mentioned earlier my name is Kristjana and I am a multimedia designer. 
                        Which basically means I spent a fair amount of my time online scanning the web trying to be connected to the top 
                        trends and designs to become the very best website, app and content designer/developer.

                <p>
                    While studying to become a multimedia designer I became very aware of the social media platforms and how they have 
                    became the new norm in our daily lives. Especially for kids and teenagers! I remember the time I grew up and how MTV 
                    was a big thing and I always wanted to be like the girls in the music videos. Well things have changed and the world 
                    these young minds are comparing themselves to are is way bigger than MTV ever was.<br>
                    <br>    
                    So I got this AMAZING idea that I would dedicate myself the next 18 months experimenting on how I can gain more control 
                    on my social media addiction and balance it out in my daily life. With my youtube channel I will share my journey and 
                    hope to inspire others to consider how they spend their time on social media and how much time they spend on social media. 
                    We all value our time and social media is known for being a big time thief. But I believe today it is a part of our 
                    everyday lives and in the future upcoming generation will need the digital skills that social media is providing. 
                    Often people want to put a end to all social media usages because they don't see the pros of what social media has 
                    to offer but I think we need to look at this differently.<br>
                    <br>
                    What if we could add more value to the time we spend on social media and even better structure it in a way it won't 
                    affect our focus and steal our attention on times we need it the most. Basically just taking back control and enjoy 
                    social media on your terms. On my journey I will try different ways to be connected and find what fits my personal life. 
                    I will also share tips and tricks on how we can add more value to our time on social media and what to prevent.

                <p> 
                    We need understand that social media is a part of our daily lives now and teach ourselves as the people around us that social 
                    media is not going anywhere. We can either jump on that train or avoid it. But what can happen if we do not follow the flow of 
                    technology is that we won't develop the correct digital skills for future employment or projects. I know people fear the dark 
                    side of the web and as well social media but with good communication and education we can inform our upcoming generations about 
                    the risks and the opportunities social media has to offer. The main goal of Too Connected is to offer insight into a healthier 
                    and a more balanced way of using social media. Helping you find ways to add more value to your time and most of all give you insight 
                    on ways you can find the best way to stay connected. Check out my youtube channel and take back control and use your time more wisely.
